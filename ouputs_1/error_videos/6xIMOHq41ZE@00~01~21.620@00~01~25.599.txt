CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.11 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 14.75 GiB of which 529.06 MiB is free. Process 11790 has 14.23 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 6.22 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 1003.83 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
